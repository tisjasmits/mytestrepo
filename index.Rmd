## Week 6

### Breakout 2

Every analysis you do for this class must start with the following two lines, which load the `tidyverse` and `spotifyr` packages.

```{r load packages}
library(tidyverse)
library(spotifyr)
```

The `spotifyr` library allows you to load information by track, album, artist, or playlist. I very strongly recommend using playlists. 

All of the functions rely on Spotify URIs. You can copy them from spotify, but you need to delete the first parts (e.g., `spotify:track:`, `spotify:album:`, `spotify:artist:`, or `spotify:playlist:`) and keep only the alphanumeric nonsense at the end. Note also that `get_playlist_audio_features()` requires an extra blank string at the beginning, for historical reasons.

Sometimes you will get a warning message that *`mutate_()` is deprecated as of dplyr 0.7.0*. You can ignore it. The `tidyverse` package is undergoing some transition right now, and the `spotifyr` developers are still working to catch up.


```{r load Spotify data}
juditha <- get_track_audio_features(c("2M5b9YLAgFroqWzeaZf86e", "3DBKc4ioGnMQLlbGQcFDIO"))
alla <- get_album_tracks("7oI0E3DdTbD85rhMg19GSU")
gilberto <- get_artist_audio_features("gilberto gil")
ecm <- get_playlist_audio_features("", "1zN4nK6oHMo2dei2WWPtSL")
```

After you load these features, the easiest way to look at them is to click on the variable in the Environment tab in the top-right pane of RStudio. That will open a full, sortable, spreadsheet-style summary of your data.

But you can also compute summary statistics with the `summary()` function.

```{r summarize data}
ecm %>%
  summarise(
    mean_speechiness = mean(speechiness),
    mean_acousticness = mean(acousticness),
    mean_liveness = mean(liveness),
    sd_speechiness = sd(speechiness),
    sd_acousticness = sd(acousticness),
    sd_liveness = sd(liveness),
    median_speechiness = median(speechiness),
    median_acousticness = median(acousticness),
    median_liveness = median(liveness),
    mad_speechiness = mad(speechiness),
    mad_acousticness = mad(acousticness),
    mad_liveness = mad(liveness)
  )
```


### Breakout 3

Let's start by loading playlists from the recent Grammy and Edison awards.

```{r loading playlists}
grammy <- get_playlist_audio_features("", "4kQovkgBZTd8h2HCM3fF31")
edison <- get_playlist_audio_features("", "37i9dQZF1DX8mnKbIkppDf")
```

Next, let's combine data sets with a labelling variable. This is the strategy I recommend for your portfolios: make a separate Spotify playlist for each category in your corpus, and then combine them with a `category` label like the example below.

```{r combining data sets}
awards <-
  bind_rows(
    grammy %>% mutate(category = "Grammys"),
    edison %>% mutate(category = "Edisons")
  )
```

The simplest data visualisation of a single, continuous variable is a histogram.

```{r example histogram}
grammy %>% ggplot(aes(x = energy)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.1)
```

If you want to compare a continuous variable across categories, you can use *faceting* (also known as *small multiples*), a *boxplot* or a *violin plot*.

```{r example plots}
awards %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = energy)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.1) +
  facet_wrap(~category)
awards %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = category, y = energy)) +
  geom_boxplot()
awards %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = category, y = energy)) +
  geom_violin()
```

To compare *two* continuous variables, you can create a scatter plot. If you have a large corpus and the points end up on top of each other, `geom_jitter()` adds some random noise without disturbing the overall pattern.

```{r grammy plot}
grammy %>% ggplot(aes(x = valence, y = energy)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth()
grammy %>% ggplot(aes(x = valence, y = energy)) + geom_jitter() + geom_smooth()
```

Good visualisations, of course, have many more components. Remember Tufte's six design principles (2006):
  1. Show comparisons, contrasts, differences.
  2. Show causality, mechanism, explanation, systematic structure.
  3. Show multivariate data; that is, show more than 1 or 2 variables.
  4. Completely integrate words, numbers, images, diagrams.
  5. Thoroughly describe the evidence. Provide a detailed title, indicate the authors and sponsors, document the data sources, show complete measurement scales, point out relevant issues.
  6. Analytical presentations ultimately stand or fall on the quality, relevance, and integrity of their content.

```{r awards plot}
awards %>%                    # Start with awards.
  mutate(
    mode = ifelse(mode == 0, "Minor", "Major")
  ) %>%
  ggplot(                     # Set up the plot.
    aes(
      x = valence,
      y = energy,
      size = loudness,
      colour = mode
    )
  ) +
  geom_point() +              # Scatter plot.
  geom_rug(size = 0.1) +      # Add 'fringes' to show data distribution.
  geom_text(                  # Add text labels from above.
    aes(
      x = valence,
      y = energy,
      label = label
    ),
    data = 
      tibble(
        label = c("Altijd wel iemand", "ENERGY"),
        category = c("Edisons", "Grammys"),
        valence = c(0.090, 0.123),
        energy = c(0.101, 0.967)
      ),
    colour = "black",         # Override colour (not mode here).
    size = 3,                 # Override size (not loudness here).
    hjust = "left",           # Align left side of label with the point.
    vjust = "bottom",         # Align bottom of label with the point.
    nudge_x = -0.05,          # Nudge the label slightly left.
    nudge_y = 0.02            # Nudge the label slightly up.
  ) +
  facet_wrap(~category) +     # Separate charts per playlist.
  scale_x_continuous(         # Fine-tune the x axis.
    limits = c(0, 1),
    breaks = c(0, 0.50, 1),   # Use grid-lines for quadrants only.
    minor_breaks = NULL       # Remove 'minor' grid-lines.
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(         # Fine-tune the y axis in the same way.
    limits = c(0, 1),
    breaks = c(0, 0.50, 1),
    minor_breaks = NULL
  ) +
  scale_colour_brewer(        # Use the Color Brewer to choose a palette.
    type = "qual",            # Qualitative set.
    palette = "Paired"        # Name of the palette is 'Paired'.
  ) +
  scale_size_continuous(      # Fine-tune the sizes of each point.
    trans = "exp",            # Use an exp transformation to emphasise loud.
    guide = "none"            # Remove the legend for size.
  ) +
  theme_light() +             # Use a simpler theme.
  labs(                       # Make the titles nice.
    x = "Valence",
    y = "Energy",
    colour = "Mode"
  )
```

#### Digster exercise

Below, I used `echo = FALSE` to hide the R code setting the plot.

```{r Digster plot, echo=FALSE}
digster90 <- get_playlist_audio_features("", "0MmrdphoTkHhChZR5ympER")
digster00 <- get_playlist_audio_features("", "6dv5FbNRVlQelteqnNDFTe")

digster <-
  bind_rows(
    digster90 %>% mutate(category = "90's"),
    digster00 %>% mutate(category = "00's")
  )

digster %>%                    # Start with awards.
  mutate(
    mode = ifelse(mode == 0, "Minor", "Major")
  ) %>%
  ggplot(                     # Set up the plot.
    aes(
      x = tempo,
      y = danceability,
      size = loudness,
      colour = mode
    )
  ) +
  geom_point() +              # Scatter plot.
  geom_rug(size = 0.1) +      # Add 'fringes' to show data distribution.
  
  facet_wrap(~category) +     # Separate charts per playlist.
  scale_x_continuous(         # Fine-tune the x axis.
    #limits = c(0, 1),
    breaks = c(0, 0.50, 1),   # Use grid-lines for quadrants only.
    minor_breaks = NULL       # Remove 'minor' grid-lines.
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(         # Fine-tune the y axis in the same way.
    limits = c(0, 1),
    breaks = c(0, 0.50, 1),
    minor_breaks = NULL
  ) +
  scale_colour_brewer(        # Use the Color Brewer to choose a palette.
    type = "qual",            # Qualitative set.
    palette = "Paired"        # Name of the palette is 'Paired'.
  ) +
  scale_size_continuous(      # Fine-tune the sizes of each point.
    trans = "exp",            # Use an exp transformation to emphasise loud.
    guide = "none"            # Remove the legend for size.
  ) +
  theme_light() +             # Use a simpler theme.
  labs(                       # Make the titles nice.
    x = "Tempo",
    y = "Danceability",
    colour = "Mode"
  )
```



## Week 7

Use a storyboard layout for the portfolio. Pretend it is meant to show your parents what you're doing in this course. Don't show any code and too much text. Instead, use visualizations!

To make a plot interactive (with mouseovers), use the function `ggplotly`: `ggplotly(plotname)`.


### Breakout 2

From now on, we also always load the `compmus` package.
```{r load compmus}
library(compmus)
```

One of the `compmus` helper functions, `get_tidy_audio_analysis()`, pulls in Spotify's detailed audio analysis for one track at a time.

Let's pull down the analysis of a recording of Steve Reich's 'Music for Pieces of Wood' (well worth a listen if you don't know the piece). For reasons that will become clearer next week, one needs to `select` the desired field out of the analysis -- in this case, `segments` -- and then `unnest` it.

Spotify segments have a lot of information inside them, but this week, we'll focus just on `start`, `duration`, and `pitches`: the three tools we need to make a chromagram.

```{r wood setup}
wood <-
  get_tidy_audio_analysis("6IQILcYkN2S2eSu5IHoPEH") %>%
  select(segments) %>%
  unnest(segments) %>%
  select(start, duration, pitches)
```

```{r wood chromagram}
wood %>%
  mutate(pitches = map(pitches, compmus_normalise, "euclidean")) %>%
  compmus_gather_chroma() %>% 
  ggplot(
    aes(
      x = start + duration / 2,
      width = duration,
      y = pitch_class,
      fill = value
    )
  ) +
  geom_tile() +
  labs(x = "Time (s)", y = NULL, fill = "Magnitude") +
  # xlim(15,25) +           use this if you want other time limits for the chromagram 
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_viridis_c()
```

Let's look at seven recordings of Josquin des Prez's 'Ave Maria'. The blank lines separate performances at three different pitch levels (transpositions).

```{r}
## The Tallis Scholars
tallis <-
  get_tidy_audio_analysis("2J3Mmybwue0jyQ0UVMYurH") %>%
  select(segments) %>%
  unnest(segments) %>%
  select(start, duration, pitches)
## La Chapelle Royale
chapelle <-
  get_tidy_audio_analysis("4ccw2IcnFt1Jv9LqQCOYDi") %>%
  select(segments) %>%
  unnest(segments) %>%
  select(start, duration, pitches)
## The Cambridge Singers
cambridge <-
  get_tidy_audio_analysis("54cAT1TCFaZbLOB2i1y61h") %>%
  select(segments) %>%
  unnest(segments) %>%
  select(start, duration, pitches)


## Oxford Camerata
oxford <-
  get_tidy_audio_analysis("5QyUsMY40MQ1VebZXSaonU") %>%
  select(segments) %>%
  unnest(segments) %>%
  select(start, duration, pitches)
## Chanticleer
chanticleer <-
  get_tidy_audio_analysis("1bocG1N8LM7MSgj9T1n3XH") %>%
  select(segments) %>%
  unnest(segments) %>%
  select(start, duration, pitches)


## The Hilliard Ensemble
hilliard <-
  get_tidy_audio_analysis("2rXEyq50luqaFNC9DkcU6k") %>%
  select(segments) %>%
  unnest(segments) %>%
  select(start, duration, pitches)
## The Gabrieli Consort
gabrieli <-
  get_tidy_audio_analysis("4NnJ4Jes8a8mQUfXhwuITx") %>%
  select(segments) %>%
  unnest(segments) %>%
  select(start, duration, pitches)
```

The `compmus_long_distance()` helper function gets everything ready to plot the distances between the chroma vectors in two different pieces. It takes two data frames (don't forget to normalise the chroma vectors), the feature we want to compute distance over (`pitches` in our case), and any of the distance measures in the table above. It returns a long table ready for plotting, with `xstart`, `xduration`, `ystart`, and `yduration`.

```{r}
compmus_long_distance(
  tallis %>% mutate(pitches = map(pitches, compmus_normalise, "manhattan")),
  chapelle %>% mutate(pitches = map(pitches, compmus_normalise, "manhattan")),
  feature = pitches,
  method = "aitchison"
) %>%
  ggplot(
    aes(
      x = xstart + xduration / 2,
      width = xduration,
      y = ystart + yduration / 2,
      height = yduration,
      fill = d
    )
  ) +
  #geom_tile() +
  coord_equal() +
  labs(x = "The Tallis Scholars", y = "La Chapelle Royale") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_viridis_c()
```

The output of `geom_tile()` can be very large if sent through `ggplotly()` and will probably not work for your portfolios. It will either be very slow to load or simply leave a blank space on the page.
